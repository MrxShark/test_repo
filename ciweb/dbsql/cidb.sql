"It was so fast."\r\nGuerin, a French photographer based in Brooklyn, captured the suspect leaping and running with his arms outstretched, and the fear on the faces of onlookers immediately after the car hit pedestrians in one of the city\'s busiest spots. One woman was killed and at least 20 others injured, officials said.\r\nThe photos, one of which appeared on the cover of the New York Post on Friday, show a scene that looks less like a major tourist attraction and more like images from a violent action movie.\r\nBehind the suspect, a man in a red shirt lies on the ground below the car, apparently injured. A woman with her face contorted in fear reaches for the young children nearby.\r\nPolice identified the suspect as Richard Rojas, 26, a resident of the Bronx with a history of drunken driving arrests. Rojas is accused of intentionally driving his vehicle into crowds of pedestrians in Times Square. He was arraigned Friday on one charge of murder in the second degree, 20 counts of attempted murder in the second degree, and five counts of vehicular homicide, according to the Manhattan District Attorney\'s office.\r\nRojas later tested positive for the drug PCP and told police that God made him do it, a law enforcement source told CNN.\r\n\'I\'m lucky to be here\'\r\nRojas\' trail of destruction was stopped when his car slammed into a metal stanchion and caught fire.\r\nGuerin\'s series of photos begin at that point, as Rojas stepped out of the car and attempted to flee the scene.\r\nShortly after running toward the vehicle, Guerin saw a group of people across the street surrounding a man on the ground. At that point, Guerin said he realized this was an incident similar to the vehicle-involved attacks in his native France.\r\nSo he ran toward them with his camera ready.\r\nPolice and bystanders corral Richard Rojas, the suspect in the attack.\r\n"I started to shoot (pictures of) the guy on the floor and I realized he was the guy from the car," Guerin said.\r\nThose photos show Rojas being detained in a ripped T-shirt and blue jeans. In one image, Rojas appears to stare into the camera\'s lens, his eyes wide.\r\nSpeaking on Friday, Guerin said it took him a while to understand the gravity of the situation.\r\n"I was not afraid the whole time because I was doing my job," he said.\r\nGuerin visited Times Square again on Friday, something he often does when he has no immediate photo assignments. He said he feels lucky to be able to do so.\r\n"If I was on the other side of the sidewalk, maybe I would have been (hit) by the car," he said. "Of course I\'m lucky to be here."', 0),
(4, 'Amsterdam Red Light District: How the city cleaned up its sleazy center', '4', '(CNN)It was raw and in-your-face, sleazy yet seductive, but Amsterdam\'s famous Red Light District has been cleaned up and a new character is emerging.\r\n\r\nBehind the permissiveness, the brothel windows and the cannabis coffee shops lurked rampant criminality -- a world of of sex trafficking, forced prostitution and money-laundering -- and authorities decided enough was enough.\r\nIn 2008 Mayor Job Cohen launched Project 1012 (named after the postal code of the area), a 10-year plan to improve the district and attract a different type of visitor.\r\nA host of disreputable businesses, such as the famous sex club Yab Yum, were closed down as the municipality tightened its grip.\r\nSex workers have been replaced by young artists who showcase their paintings, sculptures and clothes behind the windows, where once millions passed by to glimpse the forbidden fruit.\r\nNot all of the brothel windows will disappear. Out of 470, about 150 had to close their curtains indefinitely. Other landmarks such as museums celebrating the area\'s sex and drugs trade are also likely to remain.\r\nA sex worker waits for business in a window in Amsterdam\'s Red Light District.\r\nAs a local, born and raised in Amsterdam, the Red Light District has always been a favorite place for me to hang out. I liked the roughness it gave to Amsterdam, but its old character is disappearing at a rapid pace.\r\nIn its place is emerging a new, cleaner area popular with students and hipsters, with better-quality bars, restaurants and one-off clothes and trinket shops.\r\nSlow-dripped, light-roasted coffee served by trained baristas is found at several new coffee shops, replacing the coffees shops that once sold marijuana.\r\nIt\'s become a great place to wander around, but I worry the secrets and the strange will slowly be replaced by the average. I wonder if the new venues are in the right place, and risk ruining Amsterdam\'s soul -- her red lighted, stubborn, fearless soul.\r\nHere\'s where to drink, eat and shop in Amsterdam\'s new Red Light District.\r\nDe Koffieschenkerij\r\nThis is one of the best-located coffee places in Amsterdam.

(5, 'Where Do The Richest Americans Live?', '5', 'Have you checked the newest “Forbes 400: The Full List of The Richest People in America” yet?\r\n\r\nSurprise, Bill Gates, with a net worth of $81 billion, is ranked No. 1 for the 23rd year running. Meanwhile, his friend Warren Buffett fell to third place for the first time in 15 years with a net worth of $65.5 billion.\r\n\r\nThanks to soaring stock prices of hot tech firms, CEOs at the helm of those companies seem to have been accumulating wealth at a much faster pace than others. Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos gained $20 billion to boost his net worth to $67 billion, making him the second-richest person in the U.S.\r\nMansion Global is now on LinkedIn. Join the discussion.\r\n\r\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg jumped into fourth place, his highest rank ever, with a net worth of $55.5 billion. However, Oracle founder Larry Ellison landed at No. 5 for the first time since 2007. His net worth is $49.3 billion.\r\n\r\nStanding on the No. 6 spot is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, CEO of the eponymous firm Bloomberg L.P., who has a net worth of $45 billion.\r\n\r\nThese six richest multi-billionaires have a combined $363.3 billion at their withdrawal, most of which is still held as stakes in the companies they founded. However, part of their fortune is vested in real estate. Mr. Gates, for one, owns a Washington mansion worth about $170 million, several horse ranches across the U.S. and shares in some luxury hotel chains through his private investment firm, Cascade.\r\n\r\nHere, take a look at the residences the six richest moguls call home:\r\n\r\n1. Bill Gates\r\nWorth: $81 billion\r\nHome: Medina, Washington\r\n\r\nMr. Gates, 60, spends most of his time at his 66,000-square-foot Medina, Washington, mansion, nicknamed Xanadu 2.0 after the title character’s estate in Citizen Kane. The mansion overlooks Lake Washington. It took Mr. Gates seven years and $63.2 million to build this house, which is filled with lots of high-tech features. He purchased the lot for $2 million in 1988, but it’s now worth an estimated $170 million, according to public records.\r\n\r\n2. Jeff Bezos\r\nWorth: $67 billion\r\nHome: Medina, Washington\r\n\r\nMr. Bezos, 52, in the process of building his e-commerce empire, scooped up a vast amount of real properties over the years, earning him the No. 26 spot on The Land Report’s list of America’s largest landowners last year. In terms of residences, he has a 165,000-acre ranch in West Texas, a waterfront house in Washington state, three linked apartments in Manhattan’s Century Tower, and a 12,000-square-foot Beverly Hills estate that boasts Tom Cruise as a neighbor, according to Forbes.\r\n\r\nHis home at Medina, Washington, close to Amazon’s headquarters, boasts 5.35 acres and about 29,000 square-foot of living space. Aside from the main home, there’s also a caretaker’s cottage and a 4,500-square-foot boathouse on Lake Washington.\r\n\r\n3. Warren Buffett\r\nWorth: $65.5 billion\r\nHome: Omaha, Nebraska\r\n\r\nAlthough the shrewdest investor on earth holds multiple real estate investments, Mr. Buffett, 86, is known for living humbly.\r\n\r\nHis home sits on a corner in Omaha, Nebraska, which he bought in 1958 for $31,500. Mr. Buffett has lived there ever since. The house, originally built in 1921, underwent several expansions to make it a cozy and comfortable 6,500-square-foot home for the man who has a net worth of over $65.5 billion.\r\n\r\n4. Mark Zuckerberg\r\nWorth: $55.5 billion\r\nHome: Palo Alto, California\r\n\r\nThe youngest richest entrepreneur docks most of his wealth in schools, health and other philanthropies. His real estate portfolio include his home in Palo Alto and a 9.9-million pied-a-terre near Dolores Park in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nMr. Zuckerberg, 32, purchased his first Craftsman-style 5,000-square-foot home in Palo Alto in 2011 for $7 million. He snapped up four of the houses surrounding his home in the following years for about $43.8 million to better keep his privacy. But his plan to tear down and rebuild those four homes has been stalled.\r\n\r\n5. Larry Ellison\r\nWorth: $49.3 billion\r\nHome: Woodside, California\r\n\r\nOracle executive chairman Larry Ellison, 72, has an extensive real estate portfolio. He has bought up large parts of whole neighborhoods in Malibu and around Lake Tahoe. He owns a $70-million Beechwood Mansion in Newport, Rhode Island; a garden villa in Kyoto, Japan; and 98% of the land of Lanai, Hawaii’s sixth-largest island, which he purchased in 2012 for $500 million, according to published reports.\r\n\r\nHis estate in Woodside, California, with an estimated value of $110 million, is modeled after 16th-century Japanese architecture, complete with a man-made 2.3-acre lake.\r\n6. Michael Bloomberg\r\nWorth: $45 billion\r\nHome: Manhattan, New York\r\n\r\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, 74, has more than a dozen of properties worldwide. He spends most of his time at his Upper Estate Side townhouse, but he also owns estates in the Hamptons in New York, as well as in London, Bermuda, Colorado and Florida.\r\n\r\nMr. Bloomberg’s townhouse, located at 17 East 79th St., spans five stories with a limestone exterior. During his three terms as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg lived in the townhouse instead of Gracie Mansion. However, he apparently has a plan to turn it into a mega-mansion. Since 1989, he has been gradually buying up units at 19 East 79th St., the townhouse co-op that’s right next door to his current residence. Out of the six units in the white 1880 Greek-revival-style building, Bloomberg now owns five of them, according to The New York Observer.', 0),
(6, 'On day 1 of first foreign trip, Trump was seen but not heard', 'on-day-1-of-first-foreign-trip-trump-was-seen-but-not-heard', 'The entirety of his public remarks, made ahead of a meeting with the Saudi crown prince, could have fit in a single tweet.\r\nInstead, Trump let the pictures do the talking, and he almost certainly liked what they were saying.\r\nThe US leader was greeted in elaborate royal fashion here in the Saudi capital, where leaders hoped to woo him with displays of pomp and respect.\r\nIt\'s a feeling he\'s longed for at home, where a swirl of scandal has surrounded his first months in office. Instead of deference, Trump got a special prosecutor and nearly a week of damaging headlines.\r\nIf Washington is Trump\'s agony, however, Riyadh amounted to his ecstasy, replete with lavish displays of admiration for the new leader.\r\nIn Washington, activists project provocative phrases onto the side of the Trump International Hotel (the latest, on Monday, read "Pay Trump Bribes Here"). In Riyadh, government officials project a five-story image of Trump\'s face onto the side of his hotel instead.\r\nRed carpets are abundant. Outside the Royal Terminal at the King Khalid airport, workers were busy fluffing the scarlet strip until the moment Trump emerged from Air Force One.\r\nBrass bands played. Coffee was poured. Trump, who for weeks has angrily lashed out at the latest Russia reports, looked content.\r\nThe elderly King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, leaning on a cane, made the trip from central Riyadh to greet the plane. He accompanied Trump nearly everywhere, including on the 30-minute drive from the airport, which was lined will billboards featuring both men\'s faces.\r\nTrump even offered a thumbs up to reporters, his avowed enemy. The gesture was listed as offensive in an embassy etiquette guide, though an informal poll of Saudis found none who registered it as a big deal.\r\nBy the end of the day, any residual angst from a challenging week seemed to melt away. Surrounded by men hoisting swords in a traditional dance ahead of a palace dinner, Trump even began to sway himself. He was joined, enthusiastically, by his 79-year-old commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross.\r\nEven after 10 p.m., Trump was still being ferried through a royal museum in a slow-moving golf cart, the King at his side and his wife, first lady Melania Trump, perched on the back.\r\nThe royal welcome was outsized, and appeared to put Trump in his comfort zone. But in some ways it echoed President Barack Obama\'s arrival here in 2009, where then-King Abdullah greeted him at the airport and bestowed the same gold medal that was proffered upon Trump on Saturday.\r\nIt was largely an unblemished start to Trump\'s foreign debut. Gaffe-watchers found small breaches of protocol, but Trump has not caused mass offense -- as some had feared -- to his hosts.\r\nIf the first day proceeded largely without error, however, Trump\'s near silence only helped it along. At no point did Trump speak in depth about Saudi-US ties, nor did he take questions from reporters, making a verbal miscue all but impossible.\r\nOn Sunday, he\'ll have more to say. Trump is due to deliver a major speech to Muslim leaders and participate in a Twitter forum, both spaces fraught with the potential for offense.\r\nAt no point on his first foreign trip is Trump scheduled to take questions from reporters, a marked break from past precedent.\r\nUltimately, Trump\'s aides have recognized a basic facet of presidential foreign travel: It\'s the images that count.\r\nAlmost every deal and every announcement a US leader makes abroad has been pre-baked, hammered out among underlings in the preceding months. Agendas for meetings are discussed in depth before leaders ever sit down at the table. There\'s rarely a major surprise.\r\nThat means when it comes to selling a president\'s success, managing the way his trip looks to the world gains extra importance.\r\n"Gaffes are the biggest worry for any presidential visit," said Robert Danin, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "But, absent that, then the images will dominate more than anything."', 0),

Once at the picturesque St. Mark\'s Church, father and daughter enjoyed a quiet moment before walking in.\r\n\r\nHeavy rain stayed away for most of the morning as guests streamed into the 12th-century church. A downpour erupted minutes after the ceremony started and ended just seconds before the 45-minute ceremony concluded.\r\nThe ceremony took place just a few miles from the Middleton estate, where the marquee reception was held. Classic cars also brought page boys and bridesmaids from Middletons\' home minutes before the bride\'s arrival, the PA reported.\r\n\r\nPrince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Prince Harry were seen walking around the church shortly before the ceremony. However, Prince Harry\'s girlfriend, actress Meghan Markle, did not accompany him to the ceremony. It was rumored she might join him for the reception; if Markle attended, it would be the couple\'s highest-profile outing to date.\r\nCatherine, wearing a light pink dress with a deep V-neck and matching fascinator, was seen outside the church attending to her two small children. She straightened Pippa\'s gown before the bride entered the church, much as Pippa had done for her when she married Prince William.\r\nAfter the ceremony, Catherine walked beside the newlyweds as they followed page boys and flower girls out of the church.\r\n\r\nThe dress and the spectacle\r\nMiddleton\'s dress was handcrafted in London by fashion designer Giles Deacon, the PA reported. The bride also wore a bespoke veil designed by Stephen Jones and made from fine tulle with a dégradé of embroidered pearls.\r\n\r\nMiddleton\'s ensemble also included a Maidenhair Fern tiara with matching hairpiece handmade by Robinson Pelham and Manolo Blahnik pumps in ivory satin with bespoke pearl detailing, the PA reported.\r\nAlso in the limelight were 3-year-old Prince George, who took on the role of page boy, and 2-year-old Princess Charlotte, who was a flower girl.\r\nThe Duchess of Cambridge had admitted she was a little worried about how her children would behave. She was "hopeful that they would be good, but you never know at that age," she reportedly told a guest recently at a Buckingham Palace garden party.\r\nThe wedding dinner is rumored to be Scottish-themed, complete with haggis and Scottish lamb on the menu, along with whiskey, bagpipes and a flyover by Spitfire fighter aircraft, the PA reported.\r\n\r\nRise to fame\r\nMiddleton first grabbed the world\'s attention at the 2011 wedding of her sister to Prince William.\r\n\r\nAs maid of honor, her eye-catching, sleek white gown made headlines. And her svelte figure turned her into a celebrity on social media.\r\nAnd just like that, the overshadowed younger sister shot to fame. And with celebrity status came opportunity.\r\nThe younger Middleton authored a book. She even become a contributor to Vanity Fair.\r\n"It\'s been a crazy couple of years since my sister\'s wedding, but it\'s had its upsides and downsides, and I just feel really fortunate to be able to build a career as a writer," she said a year after her sister\'s wedding.\r\nAfter dating a string of high-society men, Middleton decided to settle down with 41-year-old Matthews, who popped the question last summer after almost two years of dating. Matthews\' parents are multi-millionaires -- his father, David, was a racing driver-turned-property developer. His younger brother is reality TV star Spencer Matthews of "Made in Chelsea" fame.', 0),
(8, 'UK raises threat level to \'critical\'', 'uk-raises-threat-level-to-critical', 'Manchester, England (CNN)The UK raised its terrorism threat level to "critical" -- the highest level -- for the first time in a decade Tuesday. Prime Minister Theresa May warned that intelligence services believe an attack may be "imminent."\r\n\r\nHours earlier, police identified 22-year-old Salman Abedi as the suspected suicide attacker who detonated a bomb as throngs of teenagers poured out of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, killing 22 people. Abedi is of Libyan descent, sources in Manchester\'s Libyan community told CNN. May said he was born and raised in the UK.\r\nEmergency workers and concert attendees gather outside the arena.\r\nKey developments\r\nAriana Grande suspends her world tour.\r\nPolice have carried out two raids in Manchester.\r\nQueen Elizabeth II described bombing as "act of barbarity."\r\n59 people injured, some in life-threatening situations.\r\nUS President Donald Trump slams attackers as "losers."\r\nBritish Prime Minister says police have identified the suspect.\r\nThe suspect apparently acted as a lone attacker and died in the blast Monday night, police said, which left the wounded and the dead scattered across the arena\'s bloodied entrance and sent screaming girls running for cover.\r\nTeen concertgoer Olivia Campbell, whose mother spoke to CNN during an agonizing wait for news from her daughter, is the latest victim to have been confirmed dead. Fifteen-year-old Olivia had gone to the concert with her friend Adam to celebrate his birthday.\r\nFour fatalities, including an eight-year-old girl, Saffie Rose Roussos, have been identified.\r\nBut May warned that investigators could not discount the possible involvement of a "wider group" of terrorists.\r\nThe raising of the terror threat level means "not only that another attack remains highly likely but that a further attack may be imminent," she said. It will enable the government to deploy armed military personnel of support of police and other security forces, particularly in the guarding of key sites, concerts and sporting events, May said.\r\n"I do not want the public to feel unduly alarmed," she said, calling the response "proportionate and sensible" to the threat level.\r\nThe blast marked the deadliest terror attack on British soil since the 2005 London bombings. Hundreds of residents remembered the newest victims during a Tuesday evening vigil.\r\nA powerful explosion shook part of the cavernous Manchester Arena late Monday as concertgoers streamed out following the American pop star\'s last song.\r\nISIS claimed responsibility for the attack but offered no evidence.\r\nAn 8-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman have been named as the first victims of the attack, which has drawn condemnation and horror from around the world as a heinous assault targeting children.\r\nISIS said on its Telegram channel Tuesday that a "soldier of the caliphate" was able to "plant explosive devices" at the arena, a US counterterrorism source told CNN. ISIS routinely claims attacks it has no proven connection to.\r\nAuthorities have discovered no evidence of a link between the attacker and an established terror group, a British counterterrorism official told CNN. A US counterterrorism official said bombing "looks much like" an ISIS attack but that American intelligence officials were working with British counterparts to determine more.\r\nNo determination has been made on the sophistication of the explosive device or what chemicals were involved, the official said.\r\nOn Tuesday evening, hundreds attended a vigil outside Manchester City Hall in honor of the victims.\r\n"We will stand together to say that this city is greater than the force that aligns itself against it," David Walker, Bishop of Manchester, told the crowd. "We are sending a signal not just to Manchester, but across the world that you can not defeat us because love in the end is always stronger than hate."\r\nAfter an emergency Cabinet meeting, British Prime Minister Theresa May condemned the attack as "callous" and "cowardly."\r\n"We struggle to comprehend the warped and twisted mind that sees a room packed with young children not a scene to cherish but as an opportunity for carnage," May said in London before leaving for Manchester.\r\nYoung victims named\r\nEight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos from Leyland has been named as one of the fatalities, the Lancashire County Council confirmed.\r\nChris Upton, the head teacher at the Tarleton Community Primary School, described her as "simply a beautiful little girl" who was "quiet and unassuming with a creative flair."\r\nGeorgina Callander, 18, was also killed, according to her school, the Bishop Rawstorne Church of England Academy.\r\n"All of our students will gather together today for a time of prayer and reflection and to give thanks for the life of Georgina," the school said.\r\nAt least 12 victims aged 16 or under were being treated at a children\'s hospital for serious injuries, some of them fighting for their lives, a Manchester health official said.\r\nGrande, who had just finished the first of three scheduled UK performances, tweeted about her devastation several hours later: "broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don\'t have words."\r\nThe pop star has suspended her "Dangerous Woman" tour following the attack, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN. Grande was scheduled to perform in London and across Europe through mid-June.\r\nQueen Elizabeth II said Tuesday that "the whole nation has been shocked."\r\nAround 400 police were deployed overnight following the attack, and on Tuesday, large groups of armed police were seen in several parts of the city. Security was boosted in London.\r\nTrump calls attackers \'losers\'\r\nUS President Donald Trump slammed the attack, saying that terrorists were "losers."\r\n"So many young beautiful innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life. I won\'t call them monsters because they would like that term. They would think that\'s a great name. I will call them from now on losers because that\'s what they are," he said. "This wicked ideology must be obliterated."\r\nThe US Department of Homeland Security said it was "closely monitoring" the situation.\r\nCNN\'s Paul Cruickshank, Samantha Beech, Darran Simon, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Bryony Jones, Pamela Brown, Evan Perez and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.', 0),

NBC News and the Washington Post reported Thursday on the FBI\'s interest in Kushner. Kushner\'s attorney said her client is willing to talk to the FBI if asked.\r\n"Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry," said Jamie Gorelick, his attorney.\r\nThe FBI has collected data on computer bots, programs that perform repetitive functions like searches, allegedly linked to Russia that helped target and push negative information on Hillary Clinton and positive information on Donald Trump through Facebook and other social media, the officials say.\r\n\r\nFederal investigators have been taking a closer look at the Trump campaign\'s data analytics operation, which was supervised by Kushner, officials say, and are examining whether Russian operatives used people associated with the campaign -- wittingly or unwittingly -- to try to help Russia\'s own data targeting.\r\nKushner, the president\'s son-in-law, worked with and helped oversee the campaign\'s data operation contractors based in San Antonio, Texas.\r\nKushner has described how, beginning last June, he began testing the use of data targeting to sell Trump merchandise. Eventually, according to a November Forbes magazine profile, the data operation helped the Trump campaign figure out where the candidate\'s message was resonating in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, places where conventional political wisdom suggested they would be wasting time and money.\r\n"I called somebody who works for one of the technology companies that I work with, and I had them give me a tutorial on how to use Facebook micro-targeting," Kushner told Forbes.\r\n\r\nA source connected to the data analytics group said the team has not been contacted about any Russia related probe.\r\n"We have not been contacted by anyone and don\'t know anything formally about an investigation," the source said.\r\nThe FBI focus on Flynn also touches on Kushner because he led the presidential transition\'s foreign policy efforts.\r\nKushner\'s impact grew during the transition, which one source says he effectively ran -- along with another campaign aide Rick Dearborn -- once New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was removed.\r\nThis source says both Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump wanted Flynn in as national security adviser. A source close to Kushner denied that he pushed for Flynn.\r\nKushner has acknowledged meeting during the transition with Russia\'s ambassador and separately with the head of a Russian bank. According to a source familiar with what transpired, neither meeting discussed sanctions but instead focused on establishing a backchannel to Russia\'s president. Those meetings are of interest to the FBI.\r\nThe White House referred calls to Kushner\'s attorney.\r\nThis story has been updated.', 0),
(11, 'Trump attends G-7 summit: What to watch', 'trump-attends-g-7-summit-what-to-watch', 'Taormina, Italy (CNN)Overnight, this serene town on the Sicilian coast turned into a nest of powerhouse international diplomacy. It\'s here where President Donald Trump and his counterparts from six of the world\'s most powerful countries have gathered for a two-day summit -- the G-7 -- to discuss the globe\'s most pressing problems.\r\n\r\nThe discussions between the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States over the next two days will span from global economic issues and the Syrian civil war to Russian aggression and the fight against ISIS. It will allow new leaders -- from Trump to newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron -- and veterans -- like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- the chance to shape global events.\r\nRussia -- the elephant in the room\r\nFor the third year straight, Russia will not have a seat at the summit, previously known as the G-8. Yet Russia will still be at the core of discussions between the assembled heads of state.\r\nRussia was booted from the group after it invaded and annexed Crimea, and it has remained sidelined amid its continued refusal to return the territory to Ukraine coupled with its ongoing support for separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine.\r\nBut Moscow\'s actions around the globe in the last year have only heightened concerns about Russia in the year since the last G-7 summit -- and those actions may also complicate the conversation this year.\r\nRussian meddling in a series of Western elections -- most recently in the United States and France -- have triggered widespread condemnation. Russia\'s brazen interference in the US election will be a sensitive topic at the G-7, though, as a cloud of suspicion continues to hang over Trump and his associates amid the federal investigation into contacts between people associated with his campaign and suspected Russian intelligence operatives.\r\nAnd while the overwhelming consensus among G-7 countries has been to continue to condemn and confront Russia\'s aggressive actions around the world, Trump brings a desire to boost cooperation with Russia to the table.\r\nTrump\'s most recent efforts to ease tensions between the US and Russia will also weigh heavily on the G-7 summit, particularly his decision to share highly classified intelligence obtained by a US ally with the Russian foreign minister. The move has prompted intelligence-sharing concerns among key US allies.\r\nTrump has also yet to address the conflict in Ukraine at length, and the G-7 summit may reveal the first glimpse of how the Trump administration intends to approach negotiations on resolving the conflict that have shown few signs of progress.\r\nISIS\r\nTrump has made clear that defeating the terrorist group is a top priority for his administration and in his first five months in office Trump has sought to ramp up the fight against ISIS. At the start of his foreign trip, Trump spoke in Saudi Arabia about the need for Muslim countries in the region to redouble their efforts to fight Islamist terrorism. He is likely to urge his G-7 counterparts to dig deeper in the fight against ISIS as well -- particularly in fighting terrorism financing.\r\nThe terrorist attack in Manchester, England, this week that killed 22 people is sure to drive the discussion on counterterrorism efforts.\r\nBut while Trump\'s European counterparts have shown an increasing willingness to devote more resources toward counterterrorism efforts, several of those leaders are likely to deviate with Trump\'s hardline approach to combating terrorism.\r\nTrump has tried to enact a full stop on refugees entering the United States and sought to bar citizens of six Muslim-majority countries -- a move currently blocked by court -- while other leaders, like Germany\'s Merkel, have sought to keep their doors open to asylum-seekers fleeing conflict, including those from Syria.\r\nThose diverging approaches to terrorism will be on full display during the two-day summit.\r\nParis climate agreement\r\nTrump just may find himself the target of a full-court press lobbying effort from his counterparts at the G-7.\r\nHe pledged during the campaign to pull the US from the landmark Paris climate agreement that compels countries around the world to reduce their carbon emissions to combat climate change. And now, Trump is mulling whether he will make good on that pledge.\r\nFrance\'s Macron already pressed Trump on the issue during their first meeting on Thursday amidst the NATO summit in Brussels. And Trump is likely to face more pressure to stay in the climate agreement, bolstering the arguments Trump\'s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner -- both senior advisers -- have leveled to urge him to stay in the deal.\r\nRegardless of the decision Trump makes, the US has effectively discarded with the climate deal in all but formality. Trump has signed a series of executive orders repealing environmental regulations that President Barack Obama put in place to ensure the US would meet its emissions reduction targets.Economic issues\r\nThe global economy is always a core topic of the G-7 summit, but Trump\'s presidency and the United Kingdom\'s referendum vote to leave the European Union have already moved markets and have brought new uncertainty.\r\nTrump has vowed to renegotiate reams of international trade agreements, railing against free trade deals that he has said are lopsided against the United States. Other leaders will look to ensure their economies won\'t suffer as a result of Trump\'s new approach.\r\nThe G-7 countries are also bracing for the United Kingdom\'s upcoming exit from the European Union, which -- depending on the terms of its exit -- could rock the world economy.Syria\r\nInternational efforts to bring an end to the six years of civil war in Syria and transition Syrian President Bashar al-Assad out of power have failed amid Russian and Iranian support for the authoritarian regime.\r\nDespite expressing a reticence to deepen the US\' involvement in the conflict, particularly toward Assad, Trump last month approved the first US strikes against the Syrian regime after the government launched a chemical attack against civilians.\r\nBut it\'s unclear how his administration will tackle diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict and whether he will bring any fresh approaches to the table.', 1495790987),
(12, 'First look inside Disney\'s new \'Avatar -- World of Pandora\'', 'first-look-inside-disneys-new-avatar-world-of-pandora', 'James Cameron\'s "Avatar" was a game-changer for me.\r\n\r\nIts bioluminescent alien world unfolded around the audience with an immersive 3-D I hadn\'t thought possible, even as a lifelong cinephile.\r\nAs the credits rolled, I walked out of the theater eight years ago in a giddy haze, determined see it again as soon as possible.\r\nI got to relive that feeling this week on Avatar Flight of Passage, a virtual reality thrill ride and the crown jewel of the lovely "Pandora: The World of Avatar" themed area opening at Walt Disney World Resort\'s Animal Kingdom on Saturday.\r\nThe ride evokes one of the movie\'s most jaw-dropping spectacles, hero Jake Sully\'s first flight on the back of a winged, dragon-like creature called a banshee. The difference? This time, you\'re in the saddle.\r\nThe 12-acre Orlando park -- six years in the making -- is set in an area of Pandora not seen in the film. But thanks to Cameron\'s obsessive attention to detail -- truly, Tolkien would have been jealous -- the entire planet has been extensively charted.\r\nDisney\'s "imagineer" designers chose to create the Valley of Mo\'ara, a landscape with swaths of jungle, flowing streams, a cave teeming with bioluminescent life and floating mountains. (Admittedly, these mountains are not so much floating as stacked atop one another, but one does have to work with gravity, even in the vicinity of the Most Magical Place on Earth.)\r\nGetting matched with your own avatar\r\nThose floating mountains, called the Hallelujah Mountains, are where you\'ll access Flight of Passage, via a short and gentle climb up verdant passageways, goosebump-inducing banshee screeches audible in the distance. (I spotted the man himself up at the summit: A tropical-shirted Cameron, plus entourage, seemed to be just emerging from the ride.)\r\nThe path leads to the doors of a research facility, where you\'ll encounter a giant humanoid Na\'vi avatar floating in a tube. Here, guests are roughly following the journey that new arrival Jake (played by Sam Worthington in the movie) takes at the film\'s start.\r\nNext, visitors are ushered in a small group into an airlock where each person is "matched" with an onscreen avatar\'s face. An informational video explains how you\'ll be linked in to your counterpart, already out in the world of Pandora, who will be taking a flight on the back of a banshee (or "ikran," in Na\'vi).\r\nThe flight simulators are deceptively simple: You sit on what looks like the body of a small motorcycle, donning a feather-light pair of plastic goggles. Once you\'re settled, a back restraint locks in, keeping you in a slightly forward-bent position. And then ...\r\nYou\'re off, plunging straight down from a cliff top into a valley, swooping perilously through gargantuan trees and around mountain curves, soaring what feels like inches over a herd of stampeding beasts, zooming through the curl of a towering emerald wave.\r\nWind, spray and scents surround you. It feels, it really feels, like you are flying.\r\nApparently I wasn\'t the only one who had to stop myself from yelling "More!" when the four-minute ride was over.\r\nSneak peek: First look inside Universal Orlando\'s Volcano Bay\r\nAvatar\'s stars came for the opening\r\n"I wanted to do it again the minute it ended," Stephen Lang, who memorably played baddie Colonel Miles Quaritch, says.\r\nLike most of the cast, Lane had come for the park\'s opening.\r\n"I needed to confirm if it was every bit as extraordinary as I thought it was the first time," Lang said. "And it is!"\r\nSigourney Weaver, the film\'s Dr. Grace Augustine, was a three-time rider, while Cameron was said to favor simulators number 8 and 9, which suggests he\'s been on a lot more than that.\r\n"Everyone I\'ve spoken to is just overpowered by it," Lang says. "It makes you soar."\r\nAmy Jupiter, one of the ride\'s designers, told me the experience is structured as an emotional and transformative journey.\r\n"First, you\'re put on a banshee. You don\'t know quite how it\'s going to work," she says. "Halfway through, you come to a stop in a bioluminescent cave. You have so much adrenaline. Eywa (the Pandoran nature deity) sees you. And you realize you actually know how to control the banshee. You know how to fly!"\r\nWhen it\'s time to wind down after your first (or second or third) flight, the Na\'vi River Journey, the exhibit\'s other main attraction, is an excellent follow-up. It\'s also a much gentler entertainment option for the whole family.\r\nThis slow and steady boat ride takes you through a cave where you\'ll see glowing flora and fauna, some familiar from the film and some new. Tribal Na\'vi singing and music seems to emanate from everywhere at once.\r\nAn animatronic Na\'vi Shaman of Songs greets you toward the end, her huge yellow eyes so attentive you\'ll find yourself questioning whether she\'s really a robot after all.\r\n11 hot theme parks of the future\r\nA larger-than-life wild botanical garden\r\nThe rest of this Pandoran wonderland is a wild botanical garden, full of outsized flowers and plants; the largest specimen, called a Flaska Reclinata, sprays a mist of "spores" into the air when petted.\r\nThere\'s also a natural drum circle, stone structures with hollow skins you can thump on to create rhythms. The park\'s "cast members" dressed like hippies will invite you to partake -- and many likely will, as this is one of the rare features of the landscape, beyond the two attractions, that\'s interactive.\r\nThe Pandoran botany is much more impressive after dusk, when its glittering bioluminescence is lit up like a naturally-occurring Vegas.\r\nTurquoise pods glow alongside streams full of neon-pink lilies and delicate fiery-orange flowers. Growls, chirps, buzzes and roars echo through the dark. But even in the heat and sun of the Orlando afternoon, the exhibit makes a powerful and metaphorical statement about a planet once nearly destroyed by the hubris of humanity, now restored to its former glory.\r\n"This park pays respect to all the creatures of Pandora, in the way the Na\'vi do," says Lang. "And this is coming from someone who, in the movie, represented the forces of regression and change for the worse. I think it strikes a very deep chord in people, about a wish that we have for the replenishment and nurturing of a planet."\r\nAs with all things Disney, Pandora is also commodified at the expansive gift shop and snack bars: Nothing says authenticity like a banshee key ring or a Na\'vi-inspired smoothie.\r\nThis merch is worth the price tag\r\nBut there\'s one item that will definitely have "Avatar" fans grabbing for their wallets: the $49.95 shoulder banshee, a colorful mini-replica of the winged beast whose wings and mouth can be operated with a hand control. Souvenir-wise, it\'s a standout -- and a gorgeous reminder of your four minutes of flight.\r\nIn the future, I hope Disney opens up smaller paths through the plant life areas so visitors can really immerse themselves in it. Lkewise, it would be helpful to have placards naming the different alien plants and what the Na\'vi might use them for.\r\nIn the meantime, you\'ll still come away impassioned about the value and preservation of nature, whether on alien planets or right here on Earth. Hayalovay, Pandora - that\'s Na\'vi for "until next time."\r\nPandora: The World of Avatar will have extended hours through July 4, from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. Animal Kingdom tickets start at $99 for one day.\r\nSara Stewart is a film critic for the New York Post and a freelance writer for the Contently Foundation for Investigative Journalism, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Women and Hollywood and more.

The largest, Île Sainte-Marguerite, harbors hidden coves, tidal pools and beaches and is crisscrossed by a network of well-marked walking trails.\r\nJust over three quarters of a mile long and less than half a mile wide, tiny Île Saint-Honorat is home to the Abbaye de Lérins, where 20 Cistercian brothers live a life of solitude tending acres of vineyards from which they make award-winning wines.\r\nFor divers and snorkelers -- and yachts, this being Cannes -- the waters around and between the islands are a marine paradise, home to scores of protected species under sunny skies. (The islands are said to average 300 days of sun a year).\r\nNeither island allows cars or bikes and there are no hotels on the islands, but visitors are free to explore from early morning until the last ferry leaves at 6 p.m.\r\nÎle Saint-Honorat: A very French history\r\nSince Saint Honorat reputedly drove away a menacing dragon around the year 410, monks have populated this tiny archipelago. A fortress built between the 11th and 14th century helped the friars withstand pirates, Saracen attacks and occupation by Spanish raiders, until Louis XIV garrisoned the island in the 1600s.\r\nSpiffed up in the 19th century by French restorer-in-chief Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, the fortress is now a scenic ruin. Its four floors of chapels, vaulted ceilings and arches topped by crenelated ramparts culminate in camera-ready views of Cannes, the Alpine range and the cape of Antibes.\r\nA half-dozen chapels scattered along the island\'s ring path offer moments of repose.\r\nNowadays, the monks inhabit a 19th-century monastery. Though the monastery is closed to tourists, you can visit the Gothic church and gift shop selling the island wines and other monk-made delights.\r\nIf a day isn\'t sufficient to regain your serenity, the monastery reserves guest rooms for contemplative retreats lasting between two days and one week.\r\nDivine wine\r\nThis Cistercian brotherhood may shun the limelight, but their highly prized organic wines are the island\'s big draw.\r\nTo sample these nectars, the Lérina boutique, a few steps from the port landing, offers tastings of some of the monks\' seven vintages. Saint Salonius, made from 100% Pinot Noir (95 euros or $106), has been served to the jury of the Cannes Film Festival and is regularly featured on Paris state dinner menus. Refreshing Saint-Pierre is a delicious fruity white and the shop\'s best bargain (26 euros or $29).\r\nThe monks make several liqueurs from top-secret recipes, including the aromatic Lérina, made with 44 herbs and seeds, and sunny Lérincello, made from the famously luscious lemons of Menton, just down the coast.\r\nThough you can circumnavigate the island in two to three hours, a placid stroll through the monks\' eight flower-strewn acres of vineyards and olive groves is just the thing for a restorative afternoon.\r\nÎle Sainte-Marguerite\r\nAcross the bay from the Croisette, history and nature converge on Île Sainte-Marguerite. Barely two miles long and a half-mile across, the island\'s splendid tree-lined paths, secluded beaches and scenic picnic spots under Aleppo pines and towering eucalyptus make for a perfect day outdoors.\r\nAt the island\'s southeastern edge, birdwatchers get a close-up glimpse of swans, herons, egrets and sandpipers -- plus falcons and sparrow hawks -- as they noisily congregate around the Étang du Batéguier, a pond mixing fresh and salt waters.\r\nBut the island\'s biggest attraction is 17th-century Fort Royal, the perfect faraway isle to confine France\'s most famous prisoner, the Man in the Iron Mask. From 1687 to 1698 the mystery captive, rumored to be Louis XIV\'s heir, bastard brother or even his true father, was locked away, far from prying eyes.\r\nAt the Musée de la Mer, housed in the fort, the island\'s long history -- from the Ligurians and Romans to medieval times -- is set out in the remains of a Roman vault, with captivating displays of local shipwreck plunder.\r\nFort Royal, Île Sainte-Marguerite, 06400 Cannes, France\r\nREAD: Car, Vespa or yacht? How to get around Cannes in style\r\nIsland dining\r\nYou can pack a lunch and head to one of the islands\' many picnic tables or a sandy spot on the beach with endless views of the Esterel coastline, Cannes and the snowy peaks of the Alps beyond. But outdoor gourmet dining is never far away.\r\nOn Saint-Honorat, the abbey\'s upscale La Tonnelle restaurant highlights fresh Mediterranean ingredients in bounteous salads or the catch of the day, all enhanced with a glass of island wine and glorious views. Chill out at the terrace bar to watch the many yachts glide by, with a cocktail or chilled rosé in hand.\r\nFor something more informal, you can grab a sandwich to stay or go at the adjacent Les Canisses snack bar (open for lunch from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; +33 (0)4 92 99 54 08).\r\nIn the shadow of the fort, beachfront La Guérite is Sainte-Marguerite\'s answer to glamorous al fresco dining. With Cannes in full view, you\'ll sample such gourmet delights as herb-flecked roasted sea bass, marinated calamari or pasta generously laden with white truffles. (Open every day from 10 a.m. from late April until October).\r\nLa Tonnelle, Île Saint-Honorat, 06400 Cannes; +33 4 92 99 54 08\r\nLa Guérite, Ile Sainte Marguerite, 06400 Cannes; +33 4 93 43 49 30\r\nBetween the Îles\r\nIf water sports are your thing, head to the famously limpid waters between and around the islands. Several companies -- Tahitian Adventure and Plongee Club de Cannes, for example -- can take you on a dive or supply a kayak, outrigger canoe or stand-up paddleboat for a guided trip, or venture out on your own.\r\nREAD: 10 most romantic islands in the world\r\nGetting there\r\nFerries to the island depart every hour or half hour from Cannes\' Quai Laubeuf, at the tip of the Vieux Port all year round.\r\nÎle Saint-Honorat is serviced by Planaria, the monks\' dedicated ferry service. Travel time is 15-20 minutes. Boats leave every hour starting at 8 a.m. and return from the island on the half hour (14 euros or $16 online, 16.50 euros or $18 at the marina).

I have immediately requested the indebted to show up and clarify the facts."\r\n"As we are in the middle of the World Table Tennis Championships, this incident has caused negative effect on the [national] team, which I feel deeply disturbed".\r\nThe court filing claims Mr Kong borrowed S$1m from the casino and put down a deposit to establish him as a "premium player" but has only repaid S$545,625.\r\nMr Kong was drafted into China\'s national table tennis team aged 16 and went on to become one of the sport\'s all-time greats.\r\nHe won a gold medal in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and took a gold and silver four years later in Sydney.\r\nAnd in 2000 he became only the third player to win the World Championships, World Cup and Olympics in the same year.\r\nMr Kong retired in 2006 and was made the head coach of China\'s women\'s national team in 2013.', 1496199477),

There will also be bilateral work on energy labelling, energy performance standards and the performance standards of buildings.\r\n"The EU and China are joining forces to forge ahead on the implementation of the Paris agreement and accelerate the global transition to clean energy," said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete.\r\n"No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward."\r\nWhy does Trump want to leave climate deal?\r\ngrey line\r\nWhat was agreed in Paris?\r\nClimate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere.\r\nThe Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.\r\nCountries agreed to:\r\nKeep global temperatures "well below" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1.5C\r\nLimit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100\r\nReview each country\'s contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge\r\nEnable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing "climate finance" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy\r\nTo date, 147 out of the 197 countries have ratified the accord, including the US, where the accord entered into force last November.\r\nExxon shareholders back \'historic\' vote on climate\r\nAntarctic ice crack takes major turn\r\ngrey line\r\nThe increased co-operation between the EU and China comes as reports indicate a further cooling in the US towards the Paris accord.\r\nSeveral sources, quoted by US media, suggest that President Trump is set to pull out.

She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too)."\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Court said Navratilova was a poor role model for young tennis players because of her homosexuality.\r\n\r\nNavratilova said she had forgiven Court for those comments, but had only just been made aware of remarks the Australian made about South Africa\'s apartheid regime.\r\n\r\nCourt, who won 24 Grand Slam singles titles, said in 1970: "South Africa has the racial situation rather better organised than anyone else, certainly much better than the United States."\r\n\r\nNavratilova described Court\'s actions as "bullying" and said sporting venues are named after athletes for "who they are as human beings" and "not just for what this person did on the field".\r\n\r\n"The platform people like Margaret Court use needs to be made smaller, not bigger," she said.\r\n\r\nNavratilova believes the Margaret Court Arena should renamed after Evonne Goolagong, a 14-time Grand Slam winner of Australian Aboriginal descent.\r\n\r\n"I think the Evonne Goolagong Arena has a great ring to it," she added. "Now there is a person we can all celebrate. On every level."\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nBBC Sport tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:\r\n\r\nFreedom of speech is one thing, but Margaret Court has caused widespread offence within tennis with these most recent remarks.\r\n\r\nTennis Australia has so far tried to separate Court\'s views from her achievements as a player to argue the name of the arena does not need to change. But they will find it very hard to withstand such pressure from figures like Martina Navratilova. And the current generation of players have much influence, too.\r\n\r\nAndy Murray, who is a member of the ATP Player Council, says it would be difficult for players to boycott a particular court during a Grand Slam. But he points out they could collectively agree a position before the tournament, which would make life very difficult indeed for Tennis Australia.', 1496306264),
